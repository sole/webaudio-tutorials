# drop and play

this is a thing to play sound files that you drop into the window

## TODO

* make error show something instead of spitting it out to the console
* draw current playing position. NOT EASY because there's no such thing in AudioBufferSourceNode-so you have to keep track of that yourself, which I'm not too keen on doing for now.
